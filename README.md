# Chrome Extension Demo

This repository contains files to create a working Chrome Extension where the script if Simple Analytics is integrated. It's not meant as boilerplate, but more like an example of how to use our collect script.

## `sa_pageview`-function

The auto collect feature is turned off and make a sa_pageview function available which you can set a path as parameter.

## Hostname

For Simple Analytics you'll need a valid website name for every extension. Just use something like extension.example.com. Replace example.com with your own website name. Make sure to add this to your Simple Analytics dashboard as well.
